### Task 2
To keep track of the most frequently visited players for each user, I will use a sorted set.

- Key: â€œfrequentlyVisited:userId"

- Value2: The number of times that the player has been searched

    - ZADD frequentlyVisited:userID 1 "{name: John Doe, age: 19, ...}"
3. Read
    - ZRANGE frequentlyVisited:userId 0 -1 REV
4. Update
    - ZINCRBY frequentlyVisited:userId 1 "{name: John Doe, age: 19, ...}"
